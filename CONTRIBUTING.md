Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

To contribute fork this repository, make your changes, and open a pull request.

## Setup

Install [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) then activate pre-commit hooks:

```bash
prek install
```

### Nix Development Shell

If you have Nix installed with flakes enabled, you can use the provided development shell which includes all necessary dependencies:

```bash
nix develop
```

This will provide:

- Go 1.24 toolchain (go, gopls, delve, go-tools) and GNU Make
- Quickshell and required QML packages
- Properly configured QML2_IMPORT_PATH

The dev shell automatically creates the `.qmlls.ini` file in the `quickshell/` directory.

## VSCode Setup

This is a monorepo, the easiest thing to do is to open an editor in either `quickshell`, `core`, or both depending on which part of the project you are working on.

### QML (`quickshell` directory)

1. Install the [QML Extension](https://doc.qt.io/vscodeext/)
2. Configure `ctrl+shift+p` -> user preferences (json) with qmlls path

**Note:** Paths may vary by distribution. Below are examples for Arch Linux and Fedora.

**Arch Linux:**

```json
{
  "[qml]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "qt-project.qmlls",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
  "qt-qml.doNotAskForQmllsDownload": true,
  "qt-qml.qmlls.customExePath": "/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmlls",
  "qt-core.additionalQtPaths": [
    {
      "name": "Qt-6.x-linux-g++",
      "path": "/usr/bin/qmake"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fedora:**

```json
{
  "[qml]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "qt-project.qmlls",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
  "qt-qml.doNotAskForQmllsDownload": true,
  "qt-qml.qmlls.customExePath": "/usr/bin/qmlls",
  "qt-core.additionalQtPaths": [
    {
      "name": "Qt-6.x-Fedora-linux-g++",
      "path": "/usr/bin/qmake6"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Create empty `.qmlls.ini` file in `quickshell/` directory

```bash
cd quickshell
touch .qmlls.ini
```

4. Restart dms to generate the `.qmlls.ini` file

5. Make your changes, test, and open a pull request.

### I18n/Localization

When adding user-facing strings, ensure they are wrapped in `I18n.tr()` with context, for example.

```qml
import qs.Common

Text {
  text: I18n.tr("Hello World", "<This is context for the translators, example> Hello world greeting that appears on the lock screen")
}
```

Preferably, try to keep new terms to a minimum and re-use existing terms where possible. See `quickshell/translations/en.json` for the list of existing terms. (This isn't always possible obviously, but instead of using `Auto-connect` you would use `Autoconnect` since it's already translated)

### GO (`core` directory)

1. Install the [Go Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)
2. Ensure code is formatted with `make fmt`
3. Add appropriate test coverage and ensure tests pass with `make test`
4. Run `go mod tidy`
5. Open pull request
